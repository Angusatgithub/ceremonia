        <div class="about-story-wrap">
          <p class="paragraph-light">I’ve had a chequered career path and while I’ve been a secondary school teacher since 1989 I’ve also worked in a women’s refuge, managed a large suburban bookshop, been a box office clerk in a London theatre, worked as customer service manager at a large academic publishing company, all along with plenty of time in hospitality (haven’t we all?).<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-light">Being a celebrant had been a career path in the back of my mind for some time and with the legalisation of same sex marriage I took the opportunity to get qualified so I could be the celebrant for my very special friends, Danny and Damien. I knew that being a celebrant would be good but I had no idea how much joy being able to officiate at this ceremony would bring me. I was so privileged and honoured to pronounce them, at my very first ceremony, as husbands.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-light">My time in teaching especially has meant that I have had to be flexible and adaptable, be a great communicator, and enjoy the company of a wide range of people of all ages. I bring to celebrancy a sense of calm and reassurance, organisation skills, an ability to adapt to what you want from me as celebrant, and specifically as a marriage celebrant the ability to work with you to create the ceremony that best reflects your love story and who you are, going into your married future.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-light">It's not all just about weddings though: I’m committed to making your life celebrations meaningful and memorable, to working with you to craft a ceremony that reflects your values and convictions for whichever of life’s huge events you are marking.<br></p>

          <div class="heading-jumbo-tiny">honouring life’s significant events</div>
        </div>
        <div class="about-story-wrap">
          <p class="paragraph-light">Ceremonia is all about honouring life’s significant events and enhancing the occasion through a celebration. Whether it’s a wedding, milestone birthday, wedding anniversary, renewal of vows, a naming ceremony, or a significant achievement, I will curate a ceremony that will capture the significance of the event and create a beautiful memory.<br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="motto-wrap">
          <div class="heading-jumbo-tiny">Lovingly curated ceremonies</div>
        </div>
        <div class="about-story-wrap">
          <p class="paragraph-light">I am committed to you and your needs and desires. I will work with you to create a memorable ceremony that will bring smiles or laughs while acknowledging the significance of the occasion. I will provide as much or as little guidance as you require to ensure your confidence in the ceremony. I will take you, step by step, through the process. I will provide a ceremony that is relaxed but thoughtful, that reflects your values and who you are, always respectful of all your wishes.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-light">Creating beautiful ceremonies is a delightful task to be charged with, be it for a wedding or other significant event. I take exceptional pride in this work and my ceremonies reflect that pride. Your ceremony will be personal and unique to you. Your celebration is all about you and I’m here to make it happen for you.<br></p>
